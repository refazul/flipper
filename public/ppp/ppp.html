        "This is the step that illumines consciousness and allows us to recog-nize a God of Love and Brilliance and
        Power"
    </p>
    <h2 class="title center">STEP 1-RECOGNITION</h2>
    <div class="title_after"></div>
</div>
<div class='page'>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            This first step recognizes the one life, spirit, God, Infinite Intelligence; this is the
            Creator and Creation of all. In this step you recognize God as Love, Light, Wisdom, Power, the rich
            substance of the Universe. God is Absolute Intelligence, Omnipotent and Omnipresent; these are the qualities
            of God.
        </p>
        <p>
            Create a list of synonyms for God. This is the step that illumines consciousness and allows us to recognize
            a God of Love and Brilliance and Power.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the Power within us that waits to be called into expression. Begin to have a freedom and ease in
            describing the nature of God

        "There is one life, that life is whole, perfect, complete and that life is my life now."

    <h2 class="title center">STEP 2-UNIFICATION</h2>
    <div class="title_after"></div>
</div>
<div class='page'>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            There is one life, that life is whole, perfect, complete and that life is my life now. Through unification
            we dwell in that perfect state of the Absolute and wholeness, peace and joy indwells us now. This second
            step of unification is the sacred state of at-one-ment; now are we allowing the conscious immersion of
            Spirit. I am at one with this Divine Source of all life and it flows through me right now. I consciously
            unify my human self with the Divine Self. There is no separation. I and the Spirit are one. I am expressing
            the Great Spirit in all areas of my life. This is Unification.

        "There is nothing but God, and His manifestation and I am whole, perfect and complete."
    </p>
    <h2 class="title center">STEP 3-REALIZATION / DECLARATION</h2>
    <div class="title_after"></div>
</div>
<div class='page'>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            We have defined God in Step 1; we have become one with all that God is in Step 2. In this step we realize
            and declare the unlimited nature of that self-expression within us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right here and now we declare and know that we are whole, perfect and complete. There is nothing but God,
            and His manifestation and I am made in the image and likeness of God, therefore, I am whole, perfect and
            complete. In this step there is realization that all we express in form and function is derived from Spirit.
            In Spirit there is only purity, joy and light. We realize, and declare, that nothing is impossible for
            Spirit to accomplish or express through us. Declare out loud your good and know that as you declare it
            Spirit creates it through your knowingness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spirit is the Infinite Knower and Thinker in your world creating through you boundless energy, freedom and
            ease, an abundance of good. The spiritual ideas of health, wholeness, joy and prosperity are made manifest
            in your life now. This is the step that realzes and declares the power of your word.

        "In this step we realize that there is nothing to fear, that fear itself is nei-ther person, place, or thing. It
        is only an appearance and we treat to know that any false idea that would try to inhibit my growth or forward
        movement in my life is by this word completely neutralized, uprooted, and dissolved."
    </p>
    <h2 class="title center">STEP 4-DENY THE DENIALS</h2>
    <div class="title_after">
        In this step we let go of the problem as a problem. We see it as an appearance and we realize that it is
        nothing, appearing as something. Confusion is a false idea, it is neither person, place, or thing, and once we
        neutralize and dissolve it in treatment, we find the peace that is always there. The same holds true to dissolve
        the false idea, the idea that I am without something or experiencing fear of any kind. Deny the fear and affirm
        the spiritual idea of abundance, love, faith, and joy.
    </div>
</div>
<div class='page'>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Spirit is pure, whole, perfect, and complete and anything unlike Spirit is completely dissolved from my
            sub-conscious mind. This is the step that cleanses consciousness. My consciousness is cleansed of any false
            ideas and I am now embracing life, knowing that all things are working together for my highest good. Divine
            order and perfect right action are the theme of my life. In this step we face our challenges and erase them.
            We deny whatever the thought patterns are that may be holding us back from expressing our divine birthright

    <h2 class="title center">STEP 5-THANKSGIVING / RELEASE</h2>
    <div class="title_after">
        <p>
            In this step we are grateful for the way life works through treatment. This step affirms our conscious
            acceptance of the way the Law works for us. With gratitude and love expressed as our belief in the power of
            our word, we release the treatment into Law.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this step we let go of any personal responsibility for our treatment and we allow the Law to work through
            us.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this step we are thanking God, Divine Intelligence, Spirit, for doing the work through us. We express
            gratitude and say − with love and appreciation for the wonderful way that life is working through me − I
            release this treatment into Law knowing that it is done.
        </p>
        <p>And so it is!</p>

        <h2 class="title center">Final Words</h2>
        <p>
            To learn how to treat is to learn how to live. Spend time with yourself each day, work with these ideas and
            know that as a child of God you are part of a great heritage. Believe in yourself and use Spiritual Mind
            Treatment to help you get from where you are to where you want to go. Know with me that with God all things
            are possible.

        <p>
            Knowing that God is Love, Light, Joy, and Peace and God is everywhere evenly present. I know that God loves
            me and wants me to be happy. I am at one with the peace and happiness of God. Today I claim that Divine
            Birthright of love, harmony, and peace of mind. I know that any false ideas of fear, anger or sadness are
            completely released from my consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are uprooted, neutralized, and dissolved. All that is false falls away. I am at one with the One and
